require(magrittr)
require(lubridate)
require(dplyr)
require(mosaic)
require(mosaicData)
trellis.par.set(theme = col.mosaic())
require(knitr)

## Less Volume, More Creativity

Aim for an R toolkit that is

 * **small**: fewer commands/templates is better
 * **coherent**:  commands should be as similar as possible
 * **powerful**: can do what needs doing

## The mosaic package
 
The `mosaic` package facilitates a Less Volume, More Creativity
approach.

  * available via CRAN and github (ProjectMOSAIC/mosaic)
  * builds on things in `lattice` and other core R packages
  
### Main parts of the package

  * expanded support for the "formula template" (main topic today)
  * simplified graphics
  * support for simulation-based inference with `do()`
  * some odds and ends (mostly driven by first and second course)

 
## The Minimal R Exercise

**List** every R command used throughout a course

**Organize** by syntactic similarity and by purpose

**Scratch** everything you could have done without

**Replace** dissimilar tools with more similar tools

<br>

**Aim** for a set of commands that is

 * **small**: fewer is better
 * **coherent**:  commands should be as similar as possible
 * **powerful**: can do what needs doing 

<br>
**Result:** [Minimal R for Intro Stats ](https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/mosaic/blob/master/vignettes/MinimalR.pdf)

## A few R details

### R is case sensitive
 * many students are *not* case sensitive

### Arrows and Tab
 * up/down arrows scroll through history
 * TAB completion can simplify typing

### If all else fails, try ESC
 * If you see a + prompt, it means R is waiting for more input
 * If this is unintentional, you probably have a typo
 * ESC will get you back to the command prompt

## How to play along from home

  * You can use your own R, but make sure `mosaic` is installed from CRAN (or github)
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install from CRAN
install.packages("mosaic")  
```

&nbsp;


### What do you want R to do?  (goal)

 * This determines the function to use 


### What must R know to do that?  

 * This determines the inputs to the function
 * Must identify the variables and data frame

## How do we make this plot?

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3.0, out.height = 400, fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", out.height = "35%"}
xyplot(births ~ date, data = Births78) 
```

### What is the Goal?

 * 

### What does R need to know?

 * 
 * 

## How do we make this plot?

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3.0, out.height = 400, fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", out.height = "35%"}
xyplot(births ~ date, data = Births78) 
```

### What is the Goal?

* a scatter plot 

### What does R need to know?

 * which variable goes where 
 * which data set 

## How do we tell R to make this plot?

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3.0, out.height = 400, fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", out.height = "35%"}
xyplot(births ~ date, data = Births78) 
```

### What is the Goal?

* a scatter plot (`xyplot()`)

### What does R need to know?

 * which variable goes where (`births ~ date`)
 * which data set (`data = Births78`)
    * use `?Births78` for documentation

## How do we make this plot?

&nbsp;
<center>
<h2><strong><span class="boxed">goal</span> ( <span class="boxed">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">mydata</span> )</strong> 
</h2></center>

&nbsp;

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 2.5, out.height = 300, fig.align = "center", echo = TRUE}
xyplot(births ~ date, data = Births78) 
```

## What changes for this plot?


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 2.5}
bwplot( age ~ substance, data = HELPrct, xlab = "substance")
```

### Two Questions?

## What changes for this plot?


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 2.0}
bwplot( age ~ substance, data = HELPrct, xlab = "substance" )
```

 1. Command: <code>bwplot()</code>

 2. The data: <code>HELPrct</code>
   * Variables: <code>age</code>, <code>substance</code>
   * use `?HELPrct` for info about data



## Comparing our first two plots


```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 2.0}
bwplot( age ~ substance, data = HELPrct)
xyplot( births ~ date, data = Births78)
```

## How about this one?


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 2.0}
bwplot( substance ~ age, data = HELPrct)
```

1. Command: <code>bwplot()</code>

2. The data: <code>HELPrct</code>
 * Variables: <code>age</code>, <code>substance</code>
 * use `?HELPrct` for info about data

## Comparing two boxplots 


```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 2.5}
bwplot(substance ~ age, data = HELPrct)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 2.0}
bwplot(age ~ substance, data = HELPrct)
```


## Graphical Summaries: One Variable

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 2.5, out.height = 350, fig.align = "center"}
histogram( ~ age, data = HELPrct) 
```

Note: When there is **one variable** it is on 
the **right side** of the formula.

## Graphical Summaries: Overview


### One Variable
```{r, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
  histogram( ~age, data = HELPrct ) 
densityplot( ~age, data = HELPrct ) 
     bwplot( ~age, data = HELPrct ) 
     qqmath( ~age, data = HELPrct ) 
freqpolygon( ~age, data = HELPrct ) 
   bargraph( ~sex, data = HELPrct )
```

### Two Variables

```{r, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
xyplot(  i1 ~ age,       data = HELPrct ) 
bwplot( age ~ substance, data = HELPrct ) 
bwplot( substance ~ age, data = HELPrct ) 
```

 *  **i1** average number of drinks (standard units) consumed per day in the past 30 days (measured at baseline)


## The Graphics Template


### One variable
<center>
<h3><strong>
<span class="boxed">plotname</span> (  ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">mydata</span> , ...)
</strong></h3>
</center>

 * `histogram()`,  `qqmath()`,  `densityplot()`, `freqpolygon()`, `bargraph()` 

&nbsp;


### Two Variables
<center>
<h3><strong><span class="boxed">plotname</span> ( <span class="boxed">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">mydata</span> , ...)</strong> 
</h3></center>


 * `xyplot()`, `bwplot()`

<!--
## Your turn

Create a plot of your own choosing with one of these data sets
```{r, eval = FALSE}
names(KidsFeet)    # 4th graders' feet
?KidsFeet
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
names(Utilities)   # utility bill data
?Utilities
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
names(NHANES)      # body shape, etc.
?NHANES
```

-->


## groups and panels


 * Add `groups = `<span class = "invboxed">group</span> to overlay.
 * Use `y ~ x | z` to create multipanel plots.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 2.5, out.height = 325, fig.align = "center", tidy = FALSE}
densityplot( ~ age | sex, data = HELPrct,  
               groups = substance,  auto.key = TRUE)   
```


## Bells & Whistles


 * titles
 * axis labels
 * colors
 * sizes
 * transparency
 * etc, etc.
 
My approach: 

 * Let the students ask, or 
 * let the data analysis drive 
 * `mplot()`

## Bells and Whistles


```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 3, out.height = 300, fig.align = "center", tidy = FALSE}
xyplot(births ~ date, data = Births78, groups = wday,
  type = 'l',
  auto.key = list(columns = 4, lines = TRUE, points = FALSE),
  par.settings = list(superpose.line = list( lty = 1 ) ))
```
```{r, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
xyplot(births ~ date, data = Births78,  
        groups = wday, type = "l",
        auto.key = list(columns = 4),
        superpose.symbol = list(pch = 16, cex = 1.2, alpha = .8)))
```



## Numerical Summaries: One Variable


Big idea: Replace plot name with summary name

 * Nothing else changes
 
```{r, fig.show = 'hold', fig.width = 12, fig.height=2.0}
histogram( ~ age, data = HELPrct )
     mean( ~ age, data = HELPrct )
```

## Other Summaries

The mosaic package includes formula aware versions of
`mean()`,
`sd()`,
`var()`,
`min()`,
`max()`,
`sum()`,
`IQR()`, ...

Also provides `favstats()` to compute our favorites.
```{r}
favstats( ~ age, data = HELPrct )
```

## Tallying 


```{r}
tally( ~ sex, data = HELPrct)
tally( ~ substance, data = HELPrct)
```

## Numerical Summaries: Two Variables

Three ways to create a plot with two variables.
All three can be used to get corresponding numerical summaries.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
     bwplot(age ~ substance, data = HELPrct)
         sd(age ~ substance, data = HELPrct)
         
  histogram( ~ age | substance, data = HELPrct)
         sd( ~ age | substance, data = HELPrct)
         
densityplot( ~ age , groups = substance, data = HELPrct)
         sd( ~ age , groups = substance, data = HELPrct)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sd( ~ age, groups = substance, data = HELPrct )
```

## Numerical Summaries: Tables

```{r}
tally( sex ~ substance, data = HELPrct )
tally( sex ~ substance, data = HELPrct, 
       format = "prop", margins = TRUE )
```

## Numerical Summaries

```{r, echo = FALSE}
HELPrct <- HELPrct %>%
  mutate(sex = factor(sex, labels = c('F','M')),
         homeless = factor(homeless, labels = c("Yes", "No")),
         substance = factor(substance, labels = c('A', 'C', 'H')))
```
```{r, size = 'tiny'}
mean( age ~ homeless | sex, data = HELPrct )
mean( age ~ homeless | sex, data = HELPrct, .format = "table" )
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
rm(HELPrct)
data(HELPrct)
```

 * Also works for `median()`, `sd()`, `favstats()`, ...
 * I've abbreviated the names to make things fit on slide

## One Template to Rule a Lot

 * single and multiple variable graphical summaries
 * single and multiple variable numerical summaries
 * hypothesis tests and confidence intervals
 * linear models and ANOVA

### Example Workflow: How does age differ by sex?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
  bwplot(age ~ sex, data = HELPrct) 
    mean(age ~ sex, data = HELPrct)
      sd(age ~ sex, data = HELPrct)
favstats(age ~ sex, data = HELPrct)
  t.test(age ~ sex, data = HELPrct)
      lm(age ~ sex, data = HELPrct)
```

 * Note: We can do all of this without any square brackets or dollar signs.
 
# But wait, there's more

## Some other things

The `mosaic` package includes some other things, too

 * Data sets (you've already seen some of them)
 * Support for SBI via `do()`
 * xtras: `xchisq.test()`, `xpnorm()`, `xqqmath()`
 * `mplot()` 
    * `mplot(HELPrct)` interactive plot creation
    * replacements for `plot()` in some situations
 * simplified plotting
    * additional `histogram()` controls (e.g., `width`)
    * simplified ways to add onto lattice plots
    * simple plots of models and functions

## xpnorm()

```{r, fig.height = 2.5, out.height = 250}
xpnorm(700, mean = 500, sd = 100)
```

## xpnorm()

```{r, fig.height = 2.5, out.height = 250}
xpnorm( c(300, 700), mean = 500, sd = 100)
```

## xchisq.test()

```{r, echo = FALSE}
phs <- cbind(c(104,189),c(10933,10845))
colnames(phs) <- c("heart attack","no heart attack")
rownames(phs) <- c("aspirin","placebo")
```

```{r}
xchisq.test(phs)
```

## Modeling -- makeFun() and plotFun()

Modeling is really the starting point for the `mosaic` 
design.

 * linear models (`lm()` and `glm()`) defined the template
 * lattice graphics use the template (so we chose lattice)
 * we added functionality so numerical summaries 
 can be done with the same template
 * additional things added to make modeling easier for beginners.

## Models as Functions

```{r}
model <- lm(width ~ length * sex, data = KidsFeet)
Width <- makeFun(model)
Width(length = 25, sex = "B")
Width(length = 25, sex = "G")
```

## Models as Functions -- Plotting

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
trellis.par.set(
  superpose.symbol = list(col = c('navy','red'), pch = 16), 
  superpose.line = list(lty = 1, col = c('navy','red'))
)
```
                                                       
```{r, fig.keep='last', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
xyplot( width ~ length, data = KidsFeet, 
        groups = sex, auto.key = TRUE )
plotFun( Width(length, sex = "B") ~ length, 
         col = 1, add = TRUE )
plotFun( Width(length, sex = "G") ~ length, 
         col = 2, add = TRUE )
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
trellis.par.set(theme = col.mosaic())
```

## Autoplotting (simple) models

```{r}
plotModel(model)
```

# Simulation Based Inference

## SBI -- You can do() it!

```{r, include = FALSE}
r <- 2
```

```{r, size = "tiny", echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
do(r) * mean(~ age,       data = resample(HELPrct))
do(r) * prop(~ homeless,  data = resample(HELPrct))

do(r) * diffmean(age ~ sex, 
                 data = resample(HELPrct))
do(r) * diffmean(age ~ sex, 
                 data = resample(HELPrct, groups = sex))

do(r) * diffprop(homeless ~ sex, 
                 data = resample(HELPrct))
do(r) * diffprop(homeless ~ sex, 
                 data = resample(HELPrct, groups = sex))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# residual resampling
Kids.lm <- lm(length ~ width * sex, data = KidsFeet)
do(r) * lm(length ~ width * sex, data = resample(Kids.lm))
```

## Lady Tasting Tea

 * Often used on first day of class
 
 * Story
 
   * woman claims she can tell whether milk
   has been poured into tea or vice versa.
   
   * Question: How do we test this claim?
   
```{r, echo = FALSE }
require(mosaic)
trellis.par.set(theme = col.mosaic())
require(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
options(width = 90)
set.seed(12345)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
require(knitr)
opts_chunk$set( 
  fig.width = 8, 
  fig.height = 3,
  out.width = 800,
  out.height = 300,
  fig.align = "center"
  )
```

## Computer Simulation

Use `rflip()` to simulate flipping coins
```{r}
rflip()
```

## Computer Simulation

Faster if we flip multiple coins at once:
```{r} 
rflip(10)
```
 * easier to consider `heads` = correct; `tails` = incorrect than to compare with a given pattern
   * this switch bothers me more than it bothers my students

## Let's do that a lot of times

`rflip(10)` simulates 1 guessing lady tasting 10 cups.

We can do that many times to see how guessing ladies do:
```{r}
do(2) * rflip(10)
```

 * `do()` is clever about what it remembers
 * 2 isn't many -- we'll do many next.

## The distribution of guessing ladies


```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3, out.width = 800, out.height = 300}
Ladies <- do(5000) * rflip(10)
head(Ladies, 1)
histogram( ~ heads, data = Ladies, width = 1 )
```

## How often does guessing score 9 or 10?


```{r}
tally( ~(heads >= 9) , data = Ladies)
```



## How often does guessing score 9 or 10?


```{r}
tally( ~(heads >= 9) , data = Ladies)
tally( ~(heads >= 9) , data = Ladies, format = "prop")
 prop( ~(heads >= 9), data = Ladies)
```

## A general approach to randomization

 1. Do it for your data
 2. Do it for "random" data
 3. Do it lots of times for "random" data
 
 * definition of "random" is important, but can
 often be handled by `shuffle()` or `resample()`

## Example: Do mean ages differ by sex?

```{r}
diffmean(age ~ sex, data = HELPrct)
do(2) * diffmean(age ~ shuffle(sex), data = HELPrct)
Null <- 
  do(5000) * diffmean(age ~ shuffle(sex), data = HELPrct)
```

## Example: Do mean ages differ by sex?


```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3, out.width = 800, out.height = 300}
prop( ~(abs(diffmean) > 0.7841), data = Null )
histogram(~ diffmean, data = Null, v = -.7841) 
```

## Example:  Bootstrap 


```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3, out.width = 800, out.height = 300}
Bootstrap <- do(5000) * diffmean(age~sex, data= resample(HELPrct))

       sd( ~diffmean, data = Bootstrap)
histogram( ~diffmean, data = Bootstrap, v = -.7841, glwd = 4 )
```

## Example:  CI for difference in mean ages

```{r}
cdata(~diffmean, data = Bootstrap, p = .95)
confint(Bootstrap, method = c("quantile","se"))
```


## Randomization and linear models


```{r, size = "tiny"}
do(1) * lm(width ~ length, data = KidsFeet)
do(3) * lm( width ~ shuffle(length), data = KidsFeet)
```

## Randomization and linear models


```{r, size = "tiny"}
do(1) * lm(width ~ length + sex, data = KidsFeet)
do(3) * lm( width ~ length + shuffle(sex), data = KidsFeet)
```


## Randomization and linear models

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3, out.width = 800, out.height = 300}
Null <- 
  do(5000) * lm( width ~ length + shuffle(sex), data = KidsFeet)
histogram( ~ sexG, data = Null, v = -0.2325, glwd = 4)
```

## Randomization and linear models

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3, out.width = 800, out.height = 300}
histogram( ~ sexG, data = Null, v = -0.2325, glwd = 4)
prop(~ (sexG <= -0.2325), data = Null)
```

## Example bootstrap distributions 


```{r, include = FALSE}
r <- 2
```

```{r, size = "tiny", echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
do(r) * mean(~ age,       data = resample(HELPrct))
do(r) * prop(~ homeless,  data = resample(HELPrct))

do(r) * diffmean(age ~ sex, 
                 data = resample(HELPrct))
do(r) * diffmean(age ~ sex, 
                 data = resample(HELPrct, groups = sex))

do(r) * diffprop(homeless ~ sex, 
                 data = resample(HELPrct))
do(r) * diffprop(homeless ~ sex, 
                 data = resample(HELPrct, groups = sex))
```

## Bootstrapping Residuals

```{r}
Kids.lm <- lm(length ~ width * sex, data = KidsFeet)
head(resample(Kids.lm), 2)
do(2) * lm(length ~ width * sex, data = resample(Kids.lm))
```

## Transformed Response

For a few common transformation, resample knows how to invert.
The `tranformation` argument can be used to provide the transformation
in other cases.

```{r}
Kids.lm2 <- lm(log(length) ~ width * sex, data = KidsFeet)
head(resample(Kids.lm2), 2)
 
do(2) * lm(log(length) ~ width * sex, data = resample(Kids.lm2))
```

# A Little Goes A Long Way

## A Little Goes A Long Way

Equipped with a modest subset of R, students can be quite creative:

 * The template `goal(y ~ x, data = mydata)`
 * A list of goals
    * `xyplot()`, `bwplot()`, `histogram()`, etc.
    * `mean()`, `sd()`, `tally()`, `favstats()`, etc.
    * `lm()`, `glm()`
    * `t.test()`, `binom.test()`, etc.
 * `do()`
 * a few bells as whistles as desired.

Additional R skills can be added as needed later.

 *If R is the hardest part of your course, then your R is too hard 
   and your questions are too easy.*
